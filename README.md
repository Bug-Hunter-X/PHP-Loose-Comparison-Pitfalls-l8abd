# PHP Loose Comparison Pitfalls

This repository demonstrates a common issue in PHP related to loose comparisons and unexpected behavior when dealing with null and undefined values.  The code showcases a scenario where a seemingly correct comparison with null produces an unexpected result due to PHP's type juggling.

The `bug.php` file contains the problematic code, and `bugSolution.php` provides a solution to address the issue and improve code robustness.
